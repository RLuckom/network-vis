<p>I don&#39;t have a lot of sysadmin experience. I&#39;m pretty comfortable spinning up a
VM and taking a few simple steps to lock it down--configuring SSH to use keys
rather than passwords, setting up web root directories and not putting sensitive
data in them--but those things don&#39;t make me confident enough in the security of
the machine that I would, for instance, trust it with my SSN.</p>
<p>One thing that makes me a little more confident, and that I&#39;d like to be able to
use more widely, is a whitelist security policy. My main difficulty with whitelists
is that I don&#39;t have a good way to know if they&#39;re working. When I look at the
man page for iptables, it seems like there&#39;s a lot of room for error and
misconfiguration. I&#39;d like to be able to compare network traffic as it occurs
with a predefined set of rules to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can traffic flow where I intended to allow it?</li>
<li>Can traffic flow where I intended to prohibit it?</li>
<li>Are there any traffic flows occurring for which no rules exist?</li>
</ol>
<p>I want <em>visibility</em> into the network behavior of a host almost as much as I want
<em>control</em> over it. Ideally, I&#39;d like that visibility to span multiple perspectives
of the network, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the network-centric characteristics of a flow? What are the source
and destination IP:PORT addresses? How much data is moving? For what duration?</li>
<li>What are the geographic characteristics of a flow? For addresses not under my
control, where on earth are they located? For addresses under my control, use
visual and/or semantic descriptions of the addresses that are meaningful to me.</li>
<li>Which of my internal systems are involved in a data flow? I want the maximum
possible information into what processes on my hosts are sending and receiving
data. </li>
</ol>
<p>This project explores different ways of visualizing network data to address the
requirements listed above.</p>
